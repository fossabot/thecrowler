Project status: Still under active development, but most of it is already usable.

## What is it?

The CROWler is an open-source, feature-rich web crawler designed with a unique
philosophy at its core: to be as gentle and low-noise as possible. In other
words, The CROWler tries to stand out by ensuring minimal impact on the
websites it crawls while maximizing convenience for its users.

Additionally, the system is equipped with an API, providing a streamlined
interface for data queries. This feature ensures easy integration and
access to indexed data for various applications.

The CROWler is designed to be micro-services based, so it can be easily
deployed in a containerized environment.

### Features

- **Low-noise**: The CROWler is designed to be as gentle as possible when
crawling websites. It respects robots.txt, and it's designed to try to appear
as a human user to the websites it crawls.
- **Customizable Crawling**: Tailor your crawling experience like never before.
Specify URLs and configure individual crawling parameters to fit your precise
needs. Whether it's a single page or an expansive domain, The CROWler adapts to
your scope with unmatched flexibility.
- **Scope Variability**: Define your crawling boundaries with precision. Choose
from:
  - Singular URL Crawling
  - Domain-wide Crawling (combining L3, L2, and L1 domains)
  - L2 and L1 Domain Crawling
  - L1 Domain Crawling (e.g., everything within ".com")
  - Full Recursive Crawling, venturing beyond initial boundaries to explore
  connected URLs
- **Advanced Detection Capabilities**: Discover a wealth of information with
features that go beyond basic crawling:
  - URL and Content Discovery
  - Page Content, Metadata, and and more
  - Keywords Analysis and Language Detection
  - Insightful HTTP Headers, Network Info, WHOIS, DNS, and Geo-localization
  Data
- **Sophisticated Scraping and Actions**: Leverage rules-based scraping to
extract precisely what you need, when you need it, and enact automated
responses.
- **Powerful Search Engine Integration**: Utilize an API-driven search engine
equipped with dorking capabilities and comprehensive content search, opening
new avenues for data analysis and insight.

### What problem does it solves?

The CROWler is designed to solve the problem of web crawling in a respectful
and efficient way. It's also designed to be able to crawl private networks
and intranets, so you can use it to create your own or company search engine.

On top of that it can also be used as the "base" for a more complex cyber security
tool, as it can be used to gather information about a website, its network, its
owners, etc.

Given it can also extract information from a website, it can be used to create
knowledge bases with reference to the sources, or to create a database of
information about a specific topic.

Obviously, it can also be used to do keywords analysis, language detection, etc.
but this is something every single crawler can be used for. However all the
"classic" features are implemented/being implemented.

### How do I pronounce the name?

**The**: Pronounced as /Ã°É™/ when before a consonant sound, it sounds like
"thuh."

**CROW**: Pronounced as /kroÊŠ/, rhymes with "know" or "snow."

**ler**: The latter part is pronounced as /lÉ™r/, similar to the ending of the
 word "crawler" or the word "ler" in "tumbler."

Putting it all together, it sounds like "**thuh KROH-lÉ™r**"

### What ChatGPT thinks about the CROWLer ;)

"The CROWler is not just a tool; it's a commitment to ethical, efficient, and
effective web crawling. Whether you're conducting academic research, market
analysis, or enhancing your cybersecurity posture, The CROWler delivers with
integrity and precision.

Join us in redefining the standards of web crawling. Explore more and contribute
to The CROWler's journey towards a more respectful and insightful digital
exploration."

ðŸ˜‚ that's clearly a bit over the top, but it was fun and I decided to include
it here, just for fun. BTW it does make me fell like I want to add:

"...and there is one more thing!" (I wonder why?!?!) ðŸ˜‚

## How to use it?

### Prerequisites

The CROWler is designed to be micro-services based, so you'll need to install the
following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

For a docker compose based installation, that's all you need.
If you have docker and docker compose installed you can skip the next section
and go straight to the Installation section.

#### If you're planning to install it manually

If you're planning to install the CROWler manually, you'll need to install
the following Docker containers:

- [PostgreSQL Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
  - Postgres 15 up (for both ARM and x86) are supported at the moment.
- [Selenium Chrome Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-chrome)
  - Selenium Chrome docker container 4.17.0 up (for both ARM and x86) are
  supported at the moment.

### Build from source

If you'll use the docker compose then everything will build automatically,
all you'll need to do is follow the instructions in the Installation
section.

If, instead you want to build locally on your machine, then follow the
instructions in this section.

To build the CROWler from source, you'll need to install the following:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Then you'll need to clone the repository and build the targets you need.

To build everything at once run the following command:

```bash
./autobuild.sh
```

To build individual targets:

First, check which targets can be built and are available, run the following
command:

```bash
go build -v ./...
```

This will list all the targets that can be built and are available. To build a
target, run the following command:

```bash
TheCrowler/cmd/removeSite
TheCrowler/cmd/addSite
TheCrowler/services/api
TheCrowler
```

Build them as you need them, or run the `autobuild.sh` script to build them
all.

Optionally you can build the Docker image, to do so run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <image name> .
```

### Installation

The easiest way to install the CROWler is to use the docker compose file. To
do so, follow the steps below.

**Before you start**: There are a bunch of ENV variables you can set to
customize the CROWler deployment. These ENV vars allow you to set up your
username and password for the database, the database name, the port the API
will listen on, etc.

To see the full list of ENV vars you can set, see [here](doc/env_vars.md).

There are 3 ENV vars **you must set**, otherwise the CROWler won't build or
work:

- `DOCKER_CROWLER_DB_PASSWORD`, this is the password for the CROWler user in
the database (non-admin level).
- `DOCKER_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, this is the password for the postgres user in
the database (admin level).
- `DOCKER_DB_HOST`, this is the hostname, IP or FQDN of the Postgres database.
You normally set this one with the IP of the host where you're running the
Postgres container.

Once you've set your ENV vars, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't yet, clone TheCrowler repository on your build machine
2. `cd` into the root directory of the repository
3. Create your **config.yaml** file (see [here](doc/config_yaml.md) for more
info)
4. Run `./docker-build.sh` to build the with Docker compose and the right
platform (see [here](doc/docker_build.md) for more info)

**Please Note(1)**: If you're running the CROWler on a Raspberry Pi, you'll
need to build the CROWler with the `arm` platform. To do so, the easier way
is to build the CROWler with the `docker-build.sh` script directly on the
Raspberry Pi.

**Please Note(2)**: If need to do a rebuild and want to clean up everything,
run the following command:

```bash
./docker-rebuild.sh
```

This will clean up everything and rebuild the CROWler from scratch.

### Usage

For instruction on how to use it see [here](doc/usage.md).

#### Configuration

To configure both the API and the Crawler, you'll need to create a config.yaml
file in the root directory of the repository.

See [here](doc/config_yaml.md) for more info.

## Production

If you want to use the CROWler in production, I recommend to use the docker
compose installation. It's the easiest way to install it and it's the most
secure one.

For better security I strongly recommend to deploy the API in a separate container
than the CROWler one. Also, there is no need to expose the CROWler container to the
outside world, it will need internet access thought.

## DB Maintenance

The CROWler default configuration uses PostgreSQL as its database. The database is
stored in a Docker volume and is persistent.

The DB should need no maintenance, The CROWler will take care of that. Any time
there is no crawling activity and it's passed 1 hours from the previous
maintenance activity, The CROWler will clean up the database and optimize the
indexes.
